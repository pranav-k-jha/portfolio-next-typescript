        bootcamp and learned{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-stack web development</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        is{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB
        </span>
